# Hello-World

Hello Folks!

I am a stay at home mother who is learning to code in her spare time.
I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, singing, and sleep.
I am currently enrolled in school for my Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice specializing in Forensic Science.

I'm looking forward to learning a lot of coding and having a fun wonderful journey with FreeCodeCamp.
As well as hopefully finding a job coding that I can do from the comfort of my home.
